# Adriano-Game-Engine
This is a game engine project which will use an iterative approach to versions, slowly adding new features, in order to hopefully create a simple game engine coupled with a simple tech demo.

I'll be hosting all project files here (including libraries). The application will initially be built for the windows platform, but considering that most (if not all) libraries are cross platform they can likely be built on other platforms. I might ste up a github actions workflow that automates the build process, making it easier to access from other platforms (MacOS, Windows, and linux).

Libraries:
**I'll provide all the links to the libraries I found below that may be used by the engine**
Required Components:
- Bullet 3: Physics API (https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3)
- Mach 1 SDK: Spatial Audio framework (https://github.com/Mach1Studios/m1-sdk)
- Vulkan API (Version 1.2.189.2): Graphics API (https://vulkan.lunarg.com/sdk/home)
- bsf: unfied real time graphics library(https://github.com/GameFoundry/bsf)

Addtional Libraries:
- imgui: lightweight GUI library (https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- libigl: Geometry Processing Library (https://github.com/libigl/libigl)
- assimp: 3D Model Importer (https://github.com/assimp/assimp)

I'll update the repository as the project comes along. Seeing as I have more time to commit to the project now, I should be able to push a WIP version soon.
